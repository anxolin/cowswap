<!-- # Translations
TODO: read and re-enable
Help CowSwap reach a global audience! 

CowSwap uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/cowswap) 
for managing translations. Whenever a new string is added to the project,
it gets uploaded to Crowdin for translation by [this workflow](./.github/workflows/crowdin.yaml).

Every hour, translations are synced from Crowdin in [this other workflow](./.github/workflows/crowdin-sync.yaml).

You can contribute by joining Crowdin to proofread existing translations [here](TODO: enter crowdin url)

Or, ask to join us as a translator in the Discord! -->
