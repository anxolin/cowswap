<p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS (&ldquo;TERMS&rdquo;)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>WHO WE ARE AND HOW TO CONTACT US</strong></li>
<ol>
<li>CowSwap&nbsp; is operated by GnosisDAO (&rdquo;<strong>we</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;u<strong>s</strong>&rdquo;). We are an Ethereum based organisation managed by community members. To contact us, please write to us <span>via the GnosisDAO subcategory of </span><a href="https://forum.gnosis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum.gnosis.io</a></li>
<li>We use open source products and developer materials from Gnosis Limited and affiliated persons and entities (&ldquo;<strong>Affiliates</strong>&rdquo;) as well as other third parties to provide a Platform to Gnosis Protocol version 2 (the &ldquo;<strong>Protocol</strong>&rdquo;). The provision of the Platform and the Protocol is based solely on our independent actions.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li><strong>WE PROVIDE A PLATFORM TO INTERACTING WITH THE GNOSIS AUCTION PROTOCOL</strong></li>
<ol>
<li>We provide a graphical user interface (the &ldquo;<strong>Platform</strong>&rdquo;) to facilitate you interacting with the Protocol.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Protocol was developed by Gnosis Limited and is governed by smart contracts that allow permissionless peer-to-peer trades between users applying a batch auction mechanism and without the need for intermediaries on Ethereum Mainnet, and Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanisms. We are not a custodian or a counterparty to any transactions executed by you on the Protocol. We do not support any other service, particularly we do not provide any order matching, guaranteed prices, or similar exchange or trading platform services.</li>
</ol>
<li><strong>BY USING OUR PLATFORM, YOU ACCEPT THESE </strong><span><strong>TERMS</strong></span></li>
<ol>
<li>These are the general terms and conditions ("<strong>Terms</strong>") that apply to the use of our Platform and the Protocol.&nbsp;</li>
<li>By using our Platform, you confirm that you (1) accept and agree to these <span>Terms </span>and that you agree to comply with them. If you do not agree, you must not use our Platform.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You are responsible for ensuring that all persons who access or use our Platform through your device or internet connection are aware of these <span>Terms</span>, and that they comply with them.</li>
<li>We may amend these <span>Terms </span>at our sole discretion. We regularly do so. Every time you wish to use our Platform, please check these <span>Terms </span>to ensure you understand the terms that apply at that time.</li>
<li>We may terminate or suspend your access to our Platform immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you breach any clause of the Terms. Upon termination of your access, your right to use the Platform will immediately cease. Clauses 7 to 22 and any other term intended so will survive any termination of these Terms.</li>
<li>You may have been recommended to the Platform by a third party. We shall not be liable for any agreement or terms that may exist between you and the respective third party.</li>
</ol>
<li><strong>WHAT YOU REQUIRE TO USE OUR PLATFORM</strong></li>
<ol>
<li>Users may use our Platform to interact with the Protocol and buy or sell ERC 20 tokens by submitting orders into a batch auction running on the Protocol.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A detailed step-by-step guide on how to use the Platform may be found <a href="https://cowswap.exchange/#/faq#what-is-cowswap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the &ldquo;FAQ&rdquo; section on the Platform</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To use the Platform you require:&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>A wallet compatible with the Ethereum Blockchain or an Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanism, depending on which network you interact with the Protocol. We currently only support MetaMask and WalletConnect compatible wallets, and do not yet support any smart contract wallet. We have not tested compatibility with any other wallet.&nbsp;</li>
<li>An ERC 20 token to trade&nbsp;</li>
<li>Depending on whether you interact with the Protocol on Ethereum mainnet or an Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanism, sufficient ETH or the networks native crypto asset in your Wallet, respectively, to pay for transactions fees, which are incurred through the Protocol on Ethereum or the Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanism.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<li><strong>NO FEES LEVIED BY US</strong></li>
<ol>
<li>We do not currently levy any fees on users of our Platform but this may change in the future.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Users interacting with the Ethereum mainnet or Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanisms will incur transaction costs. Transaction costs are independent of the Platform and go to validating nodes processing the transaction on the networks. We have no control over and do not set the transaction costs, and do not benefit from them. The Platform does not change the default suggestion of your wallet provider. Users may be able to change the default transaction fee price&nbsp; within their wallet, depending on the wallet used. &nbsp;</li>

</ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>APPENDIX</strong></p>
<p><strong>RISKS</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRICE FLUCTUATIONS</span></p>
<p>ERC 20 tokens are neither legal tender backed by governments nor by assets. The tokens&rsquo; value is highly volatile causing price fluctuations, as auctions typically run for some time and trades are not executed instantly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY ACTION</span></p>
<p>We could be impacted by regulatory inquiries or action, which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Platform.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING</span></p>
<p>Cryptographic assets are described in technical language requiring a comprehensive understanding of computer science and mathematics to appreciate the inherent risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRANSACTIONS ON ETHEREUM MAINNET AND ETHEREUM VIRTUAL MACHINE COMPATIBLE VALIDATION MECHANISMS ARE IMMUTABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE</span></p>
<p>Transactions on Ethereum Mainnet and Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanisms are generally immutable and irreversible. Any transaction thereon is therefore irrevocable and final as soon as it is settled thereon. In the event that you send your tokens to sell to any other destination other than the Protocol smart contracts, such tokens may not be returned. We assume no responsibility and shall have no obligation to you if this occurs, including but not limited to any responsibility to recover, or assist to recover, any such tokens.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FAILURES WITHIN DATA STORAGE SYSTEMS</span></p>
<p>Our Platform may in part be established on servers at data centre facilities of third party providers and on&nbsp; distributed systems for storing and accessing data including IPFS. Where centralised services may be used, we may be required to transfer our Platform to different facilities, and may incur service interruption in connection with such relocation. Data centre facilities are vulnerable to force majeure events or other failures. Third party providers may suffer breaches of security and others may obtain unauthorised access to our server data. Where content is stored via distributed systems, there may be interference in&nbsp; content addressing, content linking, indexing and discovery. As techniques used to obtain unauthorised access change frequently and generally are not recognised until used against a target, it may not be possible to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.</p>
